# BIM with GIS

## Pengantar

Project ini merupakan hasil dari pengembangan tesis saya di Prodi Master Teknik Geomatika, Departemen Teknik Geodesi, Universitas Gadjah Mada.

## Data

Construction projects require the support of the community and stakeholders to be successful. To communicate new planned developments, it has become increasingly important for city governments to engage with citizens and stakeholders early and give them access to the complex information pertaining to planned buildings and other architectural projects.

A 3D web scene representing the city with its buildings, streets, vegetation, and other urban objects can help the community at large experience the planned project the way they would in the real world. Instead of having to read through complex technical construction plans, they can navigate the scene intuitively in their web browser. Local governments can also provide such 3D scenes to architects and construction companies to plan their projects in context early on.

## System Design

Based on the analysis of user needs and system requirements, the backend system infrastructure obtained consists of three main components, namely a web server, server side scripting and database. The frontend infrastructure consists of three main components, namely HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
